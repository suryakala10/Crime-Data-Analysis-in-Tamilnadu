# Crime-Data-Analysis-in-Tamilnadu
Over the past decade, the state of Tamil Nadu has seen a wide range of crimes reported, particularly those involving women and vulnerable groups. With rising public awareness and digital record-keeping, a large amount of crime-related data is now available for analysis. This project focuses on understanding and analyzing crime trends in Tamil Nadu from 2011 to 2020. It explores how different categories of crimes—such as domestic violence, sexual exploitation, cybercrime, and violent offenses—have changed over time. Using this data, the project aims to identify patterns, draw correlations, and provide visual insights to support policymakers, law enforcement, and social organizations. The ultimate goal is to use data analytics to highlight areas that require urgent attention and intervention for the safety and well-being of citizens, especially women.
